2.	Age Factor: 18–25 age group shows the highest attrition(36%), while attrition decreases significantly with age.
3.	Overtime: Employees working overtime (30%) are almost 3x more likely to leave compared to those who don’t.
4.	Job Roles & Departments:
      Sales, Human Resources, and Laboratory Technicians show the highest attrition rates.
      Sales department overall is most impacted.
5.	Salary Influence: Attrition is concentrated in employees earning ≤ 5K, with rates declining as salary increases.
6.	Work Environment Factors: Low job satisfaction, work-life balance, and environment satisfaction are directly correlated with higher attrition.
7.	Higher bussiness travel frequency also results in higher attrition.
