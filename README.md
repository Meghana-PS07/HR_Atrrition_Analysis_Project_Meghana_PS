HR Analytics & Attrition Dashboard – Project Summary


Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition patterns, identify the key factors contributing to attrition, and provide actionable insights to improve employee retention and workforce stability.

________________________________________
Dataset
The dataset contains employee-level HR information including demographics (age, gender, education, marital status), job-related data (department, job role, salary band, overtime, years at company, tenure), and satisfaction metrics (job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, work-life balance).

 Key Insights
1.	High Early Attrition
A significant proportion (~35–40%) of employees who leave the company do so within their first year of employment.

2.	Impact of Overtime
Employees working frequent overtime show a much higher attrition rate compared to those with balanced workloads.

4.	Salary Band & Attrition
Lower salary bands have the highest attrition, especially in entry-level roles, suggesting compensation is a strong driver.

6.	Job Satisfaction
Departments with low job satisfaction scores (e.g., Sales, Technical roles) report higher attrition compared to those with higher satisfaction (e.g., R&D, HR).

8.	Tenure & Attrition
	Attrition is highest among employees with less than 2 years tenure, then decreases significantly for those with >5 years in the company.

10.	Demographics
Younger employees (<30) and single employees tend to leave at higher rates compared to older, married employees.

 Recommendations
1.	Strengthen Onboarding & Mentorship
Implement structured onboarding and mentorship programs to improve retention in the first 12 months.

3.	Workload & Overtime Management
Monitor overtime closely; adopt workload-balancing policies to reduce burnout.

5.	Review Compensation Strategy
Reassess salary structures in lower bands to improve competitiveness and reduce pay-related attrition.

7.	Focus on Employee Engagement
Conduct regular satisfaction surveys, particularly in high-turnover departments (e.g., Sales, Technical), and act on feedback.

9.	Retention Programs for Young Talent
Introduce career development pathways, training, and early promotions to reduce attrition among younger employees.

11.	Data-Driven HR Strategy
	Continuously track KPIs such as attrition rate by tenure, salary band, and job role to proactively address emerging issues.
