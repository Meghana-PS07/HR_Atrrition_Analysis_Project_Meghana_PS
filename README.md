 Key Insights
1.	High Early Attrition
1.1.	A significant proportion (~35–40%) of employees who leave the company do so within their first year of employment.
1.2.	Indicates onboarding and early engagement challenges.
2.	Impact of Overtime
2.1.	Employees working frequent overtime show a much higher attrition rate compared to those with balanced workloads.
3.	Salary Band & Attrition
3.1.	Lower salary bands have the highest attrition, especially in entry-level roles, suggesting compensation is a strong driver of turnover.
4.	Job Satisfaction
4.1.	Departments with low job satisfaction scores (e.g., Sales, Technical roles) report higher attrition compared to those with higher satisfaction (e.g., R&D, HR).
5.	Tenure & Attrition
5.1.	Attrition is highest among employees with less than 2 years tenure, then decreases significantly for those with >5 years in the company.
6.	Demographics
6.1.	Younger employees (<30) and single employees tend to leave at higher rates compared to older, married employees.

1.1.	Implement structured onboarding and mentorship programs to improve retention in the first 12 months.
2.	Workload & Overtime Management

3.	Review Compensation Strategy
3.1.	Reassess salary structures in lower bands to improve competitiveness and reduce pay-related attrition.
4.	Focus on Employee Engagement
4.1.	Conduct regular satisfaction surveys, particularly in high-turnover departments (e.g., Sales, Technical), and act on feedback.
5.	Retention Programs for Young Talent
5.1.	Introduce career development pathways, training, and early promotions to reduce attrition among younger employees.
6.	Data-Driven HR Strategy
6.1.	Continuously track KPIs such as attrition rate by tenure, salary band, and job role to proactively address emerging issues.
